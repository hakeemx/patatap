# Patatap

This is a Patatap clone I made. I've used javascript animations to get the job done. 
Each button has it's own sound, color, position and size. 

# How it works
Random circles will appear on a random location on the screen when a button is pressed. 
##### Each button will have its own sound and color.
##### The circle(Bubble) will then animate out on screen
